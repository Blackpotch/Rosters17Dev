Add fictional names to the data sheet to force the macro to show all the lines in the 
roster sheet.

Changed the startfromscratch attribute in RibbonUi to false so as to enable the excel
commands. Also the toggle button on the RibbonUi now displays a label of PDO rather
than RDO

Replaced RO in the datasheet with PO. We have been confusing Rostered Days off with
Paid Days off.
Modified the Subs "GetTglMarkPressed(control As IRibbonControl, ByRef returnedVal)"
and "ChangeAutoMark(control As IRibbonControl, pressed As Boolean)" in vba module 
mdlRibbon and "SetAutoMark()" in module shtRoster so that automark will now display 
PO rather than RO

Modify the Caption property of the optRDO option control on the sheet to diplay PDO
rather than RDO
