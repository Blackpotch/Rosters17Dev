Add fictional names to the data sheet to force the macro to show all the lines in the 
roster sheet.

Change the startfromscratch attribute in RibbonUi to false so as to enable the excel
commands. Also the toggle button on the RibbonUi now displays a label of PDO rather
than RDO.

Replace RO in the datasheet with PO. We have been confusing Rostered Days off with
Paid Days off.
Modified the Subs "GetTglMarkPressed(control As IRibbonControl, ByRef returnedVal)"
and "ChangeAutoMark(control As IRibbonControl, pressed As Boolean)" in vba module 
mdlRibbon and "SetAutoMark()" in module shtRoster so that automark will now display 
PO rather than RO.

Modify the Caption property of the optRDO option control on the sheet to diplay PDO
rather than RDO.

17/02/2017****************************************************************************

Modify the formula in the Summary Sheet so that it counts PO rather than RO on the 
Rosters sheet. Also change the heading on the Summary Sheet to show PDO rather than RDO.

26/02/2017****************************************************************************

Changes to PDO need to be made once again. This time an X is required rather than PO.
Also a . is needed in place of a blank for days that are rostered off unpaid RO.

So have changed the shifts range in the data sheet to show and X in place of RO. This is
the range the dropdown boxes for the cells in the roster sheet uses.
Added a couple of rows above the rosters in the roster sheet. This needs to be tested.
Add a legend to the top of the rosters sheet.

Add an option box optRosteredOff to the sheet controls and modify the VBA to have the
automark feature work. Modify the formulas on the RDO column of the summary sheet to count
X rather than PO.
