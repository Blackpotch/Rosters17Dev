16/02/2017****************************************************************************

Add fictional names to the data sheet to force the macro to show all the lines in the 
roster sheet.

Change the startfromscratch attribute in RibbonUi to false so as to enable the excel
commands. Also the toggle button on the RibbonUi now displays a label of PDO rather
than RDO.

Replace RO in the datasheet with PO. We have been confusing Rostered Days off with
Paid Days off.
Modified the Subs "GetTglMarkPressed(control As IRibbonControl, ByRef returnedVal)"
and "ChangeAutoMark(control As IRibbonControl, pressed As Boolean)" in vba module 
mdlRibbon and "SetAutoMark()" in module shtRoster so that automark will now display 
PO rather than RO.

Modify the Caption property of the optRDO option control on the sheet to diplay PDO
rather than RDO.

17/02/2017****************************************************************************

Modify the formula in the Summary Sheet so that it counts PO rather than RO on the 
Rosters sheet. Also change the heading on the Summary Sheet to show PDO rather than RDO.

26/02/2017****************************************************************************

Changes to PDO need to be made once again. This time an X is required rather than PO.
Also a . is needed in place of a blank for days that are rostered off unpaid RO.

So have changed the shifts range in the data sheet to show and X in place of RO. This is
the range the dropdown boxes for the cells in the roster sheet uses.
Added a couple of rows above the rosters in the roster sheet. This needs to be tested.
Add a legend to the top of the rosters sheet.

Add an option box optRosteredOff to the sheet controls and modify the VBA to have the
automark feature work. Modify the formulas on the RDO column of the summary sheet to count
X rather than PO.

17/04/17*******************************************************************************
Add check box to the ribbonUI to show/hide the Legend and Test

24/04/17*******************************************************************************
The RibbonUI checkboxes for Legend and Sheet controls were not behaving correctly in that 
they were showing checked when no controls were visible when coming from another sheet.
Modified the functions to solve.
The workbook_open function was setting the flags incorrectly for the same checkboxes mentioned
above. This function has been fixed.

17/05/17*******************************************************************************
Change the heading in the summary sheet from RDO to PDO
Add comments to the subroutine with fires add and remove employees names in the roster sheet 

4/07/17********************************************************************************
Modify the clear option in Automark to leave a "." rather than clear
Change the conditional formatting to suit the new roster codes
Change the ribbon to only show the roster tab

2/12/18********************************************************************************
I need to add a feature to highlight the Period Ending days. These can only be on a Friday.
Therefore I'm considering a dropdown option with a couple of Friday dates early in July and a new Range. So...
* Edit the ribbon XML to allow access to the Excel menus
* Fix the formula problem on the summary sheet where Emp7's SP shifts were adding emp6's SP shifts instead
* Begin editing the RostersRibUI XML file
* Commit
* Complete adding the dropdown XML in the RostersRibUI file
* Add the VBA callbacks 
* Add the VBA to populate the dropdown with the Period Ending Dates
* Commit
* 17/12/18
* Add the list of Period Endings to the data sheet
* Note: a bug has appeared not putting the value in the data range from the
  dropdown. Looks like some debugging to do
* Commit
* 18/12/18
* Debug the the value transfer, the date was changing format from dd/mm/yyy to mm/dd/yyy
* By using the the text "Jul" in the date the was sorted
* Invalidate the control whenever the Year Ending is changed
* Commit
* Code the two sub routines to highlight the Periods Ending
* Commit
